## Architecture

### [Client-Side Architecture Basics](https://khalilstemmler.com/articles/client-side-architecture/introduction/)[architecture,frontend,model-view-presenter,observer,react]

Though the tools we use to build client-side web apps have changed substantially over the years, the fundamental principles behind designing robust software have remained relatively the same. In this guide, we go back to basics and discuss a better way to think about the front-end architecture using modern tools like React, Redux, xState, and Apollo Client.

## Auth

### [The Ultimate Guide to JWT client side auth (Stop using local storage!!!)](https://dev.to/bahdcoder/the-ultimate-guide-to-jwt-client-side-auth-stop-using-local-storage-3an9[auth,javascript,react]

The most popular practice in the industry today is to save your JWT in a cookie or local storage. I've done this for a couple of years, and I have even taught others to do the same, but I didn't think it was a big deal until one of the applications I worked on was hacked.

The solution we want to talk about today is one that would, first of all, prevent us from saving our tokens in a risky place, and secondly, implementing another solution that makes sure even if the attacker manages to get hold of a token, the access to the API would expire almost immediately.

## Browser API

### [Use FileSaver to save PDFs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/file-saver)[browser-api,file-saver,blob,array-buffer]

For downloading a PDF you need to transform it into a [Blob](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob/Blob), for example by converting it into an [ArrayBuffer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/ArrayBuffer) first, before you can download it with [FileSaver](https://www.npmjs.com/package/file-saver).

```typescript
import { saveAs } from "file-saver";

function downloadPdf(pdfData: ArrayBuffer, filename: string = "save.pdf") {
  const blob = new Blob([pdfData], { type: "application/pdf" });
  saveAs(blob, filename);
}

function toArrayBuffer(pdfBinaryString: string) {
  const buffer = new ArrayBuffer(binaries.length);
  const view = new Uint8Array(buffer);
  for (let i = 0; i < binaries.length; i++) {
    view[i] = binaries.charCodeAt(i);
  }
  return buffer;
}
```

### [Converting JavaScript callbacks to Promise and Async-Await](https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/converting-javascript-callbacks-to-promise-and-async-await-replacing-async-waterfall-method-with-3c8b7487e0b9)[browser-api,javascript,async-await,callback,promise]

On regular day of a developer, we have to convert quite a bit of legacy code that uses traditional callbacks to Promises and async-await, both for taking advantage of the latest features of ES6 and also to avoid callback-hell and making the code more beautiful and compact and human readable.

## CSS

### [10 Best Practices for Improving Your CSS](https://medium.com/better-programming/10-best-practices-for-improving-your-css-84c69aac66e)[css]

1. Do You Really Need a Framework?

   There are now many lightweight alternatives to robust frameworks. Usually, you won‚Äôt be using every selector from a framework, so your bundle will contain dead code.

2. Prefer Using a CSS Methodology

   CSS methodologies are used to create consistency in your CSS files. They help in scaling and maintaining your projects.

3. Set Up a Pre-Processor

   A pre-processor is a tool that lets you use advanced features that don‚Äôt exist in CSS. These can be things like variables for loops, or even functions.

4. Use Markup Instead of CSS

   Usually, you can reduce the size of your CSS bundles by simply using the correct HTML elements.

5. Use Shorthand Properties

   To further reduce the number of rules, always try to go with shorthand properties.

6. Reduce Redundancy

   Sometimes it‚Äôs hard to spot redundancy, especially when repeating rules don‚Äôt follow the same order in both selectors. But if your classes differ in just one or two rules, it‚Äôs better to outsource those rules and use them as an extra class.

7. Avoid Complex Selectors

   First, your increased specificity will not only make it harder to later rewrite existing rules, but also increase the time it takes for the browser to match selectors.

8. Don‚Äôt Remove Outlines

   This is one of the most common mistakes developers make when writing CSS. While you may think there‚Äôs nothing wrong about removing the highlight that outlines create, in fact, you‚Äôre making the site inaccessible. If the default styling looks bad for your brand, create custom outlines. Just make sure there is some kind of indication when it comes to focusing elements.

9. Use Mobile First

   The mobile-first approach means you start writing CSS for small screen devices first and build from there. This is also called progressive enhancement. How can you tell if you use mobile-first? If your media queries use `min-width`, you‚Äôre on the right track.

10. Compress

    Compression removes comments and whitespaces your bundles require less bandwidth to fetch.

### [Stop using CSS in JavaScript for web development](https://medium.com/@gajus/stop-using-css-in-javascript-for-web-development-fa32fb873dcc)[css,css-in-js,css-modules,styled-components]

CSS isn‚Äôt going anywhere. A lot of the projects choose to style documents in JavaScript for wrong reasons. This article lists common misconceptions (myths) and the existing CSS solutions to those problems.

`styled-components` (just like CSS modules) take away the responsibility of the naming away from the human. Humans make mistakes; computers make them less often so.
On its own, it is not a good enough reason to start using `styled-components`.

Most (if not all) of these things can be addressed long term, either by the community, changes in React or in `styled-components` itself. But whats the point? CSS is already widely supported, it has massive community around it and it just works.
The point of this article is not to deter the reader from using ‚ÄúCSS‚Äù in JavaScript or from using `styled-components`. Styling using `styled-components` has a great use case: a better cross-platform support. Don‚Äôt use it for wrong reasons.

Use CSS with either of the naming conventions (I recommend [BEM](http://getbem.com/)). If you are worried about class name collisions (or too lazy to use BEM), use [CSS modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules). If you are developing for React web, consider using [babel-plugin-react-css-modules](https://github.com/gajus/babel-plugin-react-css-modules). If you are developing for React native, [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) is great.

### [Why I Write CSS in JavaScript](https://mxstbr.com/thoughts/css-in-js)[css,css-in-js,styled-components]

Primarily, CSS-in-JS boosts my confidence. I can add, change and delete CSS without any unexpected consequences. My changes to the styling of a component will not affect anything else. If I delete a component, I delete its CSS too. No more [append-only stylesheets](https://css-tricks.com/oh-no-stylesheet-grows-grows-grows-append-stylesheet-problem/)! ‚ú®

- **Confidence**: Add, change and delete CSS without any unexpected consequences and avoid dead code.
- **Painless Maintenance**: Never go on a hunt for CSS affecting your components ever again.
- **Enhanced Teamwork**: Avoid common CSS frustrations to keep a neat codebase and moving quickly, regardless of experience levels.
- **Fast Performance**: Send only the critical CSS to the user for a rapid first paint.
- **Dynamic Styling**: Simply style your components with a global theme or based on different states.

### [Styled Components vs. CSS Stylesheets](https://getstream.io/blog/styled-components-vs-css-stylesheets/)[css,css-in-js,styled-components]

There‚Äôs a hot debate around standard CSS stylesheets vs. ‚ÄúCSS-in-JS‚Äù solutions when building in modern front-end frameworks. In this post, I‚Äôm going to weigh up the pros and cons of CSS vs. Styled Components and how it affects the way I write React components.

**Pros**

- No Globally Scoped Selectors
- Consistency
- Sass Syntax Out-Of-The-Box
- Theming
- Dynamic Styling

**Cons**

- Learning Curve
- Integration With Legacy CSS Can Be Painful
- Potentially a "Fad"
- Performance

### [EQCSS (Element Queries CSS)](https://elementqueries.com/)[css]

Element queries are a new way of thinking about responsive web design where the responsive conditions apply to elements on the page instead of the width or height of the browser.

Unlike CSS @media queries, @element Queries are aware of more than just the width and height of the browser, you can write responsive conditions for a number of different situations like how many characters of text or child elements an element contains.

Another concept that element queries brings to CSS is the idea of ‚Äòscoping‚Äô your styles to one element in the same way that JavaScript functions define a new scope for the variables they contain.

QCSS is a JavaScript plugin that lets you write element queries inside CSS today. With performance in mind, this plugin is written in pure JavaScript, so it doesn't require jQuery or any other libraries on your page in order to function - add [EQCSS.js](https://github.com/eqcss/eqcss) to your HTML and you‚Äôre ready to get started!

## Git

### [Delete all branches except master](https://www.hacksparrow.com/git/delete-all-branches-except-master.html)[git]

During the normal course of a project, git repositories can accumulate a number of branches locally. A few branches may be fine, but sometimes they can pile up and lead to an unacceptably large number of branches. That's when it is time for a branch clean up!

First, make sure you are on master:

```sh
git checkout master
```

Then run this command:

```sh
git branch | grep -v '^*' | xargs git branch -D
```

It will delete all the local branches, whether they have been merged to master or not.

Now, what if you want to be a little less adventurous and delete only branches that have been merged to master?

This command will do that for you:

```sh
git branch | grep -v '^*' | xargs git branch -d
```

## HTTP

### [Content-Security-Ploicy Header (CSP)](https://content-security-policy.com/)[csp,http,security]

The new Content-Security-Policy HTTP response header helps you reduce XSS risks on modern browsers by declaring, which dynamic resources are allowed to load

## JSON

### [JSON Stringify of Circular Structures](https://stackoverflow.com/a/11616993)[json,json-stringify,circular-structure]

```typescript
// custom replacer that uses a local cache
const createStringifyReplacer = (replacer?: (this: any, key: string, value: any) => any) => (cache: any[]) => (
  key: string,
  value: any
) => {
  if (typeof value === "object" && value !== null) {
    if (cache.includes(value)) return;
    cache.push(value);
  }
  return replacer ? replacer(key, value) : value;
};

// a wrapper around JSON.stringify, using a custom replacer
export function stringify(
  value: any,
  replacer?: (this: any, key: string, value: any) => any,
  space?: string | number
): string {
  return JSON.stringify(value, createStringifyReplacer(replacer)([]), space);
}
```

## Kubernetes

### [Kubectl Cheat Sheet](https://unofficial-kubernetes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/kubectl-cheatsheet/)[kubernetes,kubectl,cheat-sheet]

`history | grep kubectl` - Listet alle in der Shell get√§tigten Befehle mit "kubectl" auf

## React

### [Runtime environment variables ‚Äî create-react-app](https://medium.com/@andrewmclagan_64462/runtime-environment-variables-create-react-app-84f7c261856c)[react,create-react-app,env]

We simply need to create static JSON containing the white listed `REACT_APP` variables when the app starts. To do this [`react-env`](https://github.com/andrewmclagan/react-env) reads your environment as per the CRA standards and generates a `env.js` file before you app starts. This file can be statically served during development or in production. The environment configuration will be available via `window._env`. Simple.

### [Content Security Policy (CSP) in Create-React-App (CRA)](https://medium.com/@nrshahri/csp-cra-324dd83fe5ff)[create-react-app,csp,http,react,security,webpack]

Writing suitable CSP policy may require some changes to your app build pipeline to fetch and calculate hashes for inline scripts and styles, which are used.

I encountered a few challenges with restrictiions through CSPs:

- Some libraries, for example `@fortawesome/react-fontawesome`, use inline styling. That means I had to use the `'unsafe-inline'` `style-src` policy.
- For the `'unsafe-inline'` policy to work no `hash` or `nonce` `style-src` policies are allowed.
- I had to add the `data:` policy to `connect-src` otherwise the `libsodium` library couldn't load it's `octet-stream`.
- Last but not least I had to add the `'unsafe-eval'` policy to `script-src` because otherwise the WebAssembly module for the `argon2-browser` library couldn't be used.

As you can see there were quite a few restrictions. To be fair, I have not enough knowledge about CSP, WebAssembly or Webpack to guarantee that there is no other solutions to those issues. Here is my `config-overrides.js` for `react-app-rewired` to adjust the `webpack` configuration.

```javascript
const { override } = require("customize-cra");
const cspHtmlWebpackPlugin = require("csp-html-webpack-plugin");

const cspConfigPolicy = {
  "default-src": "'self'",
  "connect-src": ["'self'", "backend-api-url.com", "data:"],
  "script-src": ["'self'", "'unsafe-eval'"],
  "style-src": ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],
};

const cspOptions = {
  hashEnabled: {
    "script-src": true,
    "style-src": false,
  },
  nonceEnabled: {
    "script-src": true,
    "style-src": false,
  },
};

function addCspHtmlWebpackPlugin(config) {
  if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "production") {
    config.plugins.push(new cspHtmlWebpackPlugin(cspConfigPolicy, cspOptions));
  }

  return config;
}

module.exports = {
  webpack: override(addCspHtmlWebpackPlugin),
};
```

### [8 ways to deploy a React app for free](https://blog.logrocket.com/8-ways-to-deploy-a-react-app-for-free/)[react,deployment]

It‚Äôs time that you took your applications out of development and into production. The process of deploying an application built on top of a framework such as React, Vue, or Angular is much different from that of deploying a site built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

In this tutorial, we‚Äôll demonstrate how to deploy a React application in eight different ways. All the services described in this post are completely free with no hidden credit card requirements.

### [Examples of large production-grade, open-source React apps](https://maxrozen.com/examples-of-large-production-grade-open-source-react-apps/)[react,real-world-app]

It‚Äôs bloody hard to find a good example of a large production-grade, open-source React app.

There are a few reasons for this:

1. No one writes amazing code the first time they write it

   - Experienced product engineers know there‚Äôs a trade-off between quality and getting features in the hands of customers. You‚Äôre more likely to find ugly tech debt with a //TODO: Improve this later! comment than best practices

2. Most companies keep their apps in private repos

   - Trade secrets and all that jazz.

3. There‚Äôs a lot of beginner-grade repos out there

   - Without a ton of experience, it‚Äôs hard to tell the good from the bad

On that note, I‚Äôve reviewed the following well-known open-source React apps, and reckon they‚Äôre worth checking out.

### [The styled-components happy path](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/styled-components/)[react,styled-components,css]

In this article, we've looked at some styled-components-specific APIs, but really the ideas I hope to convey are bigger than any specific tool or library.

When we extend the component mindset to our CSS, we gain all sorts of new superpowers:

- The ability to know, with confidence, whether it's safe to remove a CSS declaration (no possibility of it affecting some totally-separate part of the application!).
- A complete lack of specificity issues, no more trying to find tricks to bump up specificity.
- A neat and trim mental model that fits in your head and helps you understand exactly what your pages will look like, without needing to do a bunch of manual testing.

## State Management

### [State Machines and State Charts](https://github.com/fea-education/state-machine)[state-management,state-machine,state-chart,xtstat,robot]

You can find a great documentation on [State Machines](https://statecharts.github.io/what-is-a-state-machine.html) and [State Charts](https://statecharts.github.io/what-is-a-statechart.html) at [statecharts.github.io](https://statecharts.github.io/) and [github.com/leonardomso/awesome-fsm](https://github.com/leonardomso/awesome-fsm). I don't feel like just repeating everything. I'd rather just try make you curious about state machines and give you a quick overview on the topic.

### [State Machines in React](https://mastery.games/post/state-machines-in-react/)[state-management,react,state-machine,xstate]

One of the biggest pain points when developing an app is the tricky business of managing state. Many bugs are caused by things getting into unexpected states, or by race conditions. Finite state machines can help eliminate both types of bugs entirely, while providing a welcome, structured way to build components.

### [Async Guards with XState](https://github.com/davidkpiano/xstate/issues/533#issuecomment-510459432)[state-management,async,state-machine,xstate]

With state machines and statecharts, all states (including intermediate states) must be explicit. So instead of:

![A -- EVENT [async guard] --> B](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1093738/61049718-2ebb2180-a3b3-11e9-8ca1-1d08dd5de0b3.png "A -- EVENT [async guard] --> B")

You would model this with some sort of intermediate "checking" state that invokes the async guard:

![A -- EVENT --> CHECKING -- GUARD.SUCCESS --> B](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1093738/61049734-38448980-a3b3-11e9-8ac6-077a8605cee0.png "A -- EVENT --> CHECKING -- GUARD.SUCCESS --> B")

Which might look something like:

```javascript
CHECKING: {
  invoke: {
    src: 'asyncGuard',
    onDone: 'B',
    onError: 'A'
  }
}
```

### [Multistep form handling with Finite State Machines, Formik and TypeScript](https://thewidlarzgroup.com/multistep-form-xstate-formik/)[state-management,form,formik,react,react-native,state-machine,typescript,validation,xstate,yup]

Lately, I had a chance to work on a mobile app that utilizes this concept of finite state machines. Having no prior knowledge on such thing as a state machine, I quickly got to liking it!

Basically, the concept of such state machines is that we have a finite number of states and we can transition between these states while also exchanging some data. We can declare multiple machines which can handle different tasks and behave in a different way, as well as declare some universal ones that can be re-used. That being said, we can think of our app as a combination of state machines that, based on their states, render different parts of UI. For example, fetching data from the back-end - we are either in a fetching state (we can render some kind of a loader at this time) or in a done state where we can display all the fetched data along with some kind of information about our request status, e.g. whether it was successful or not.

If you want to start developing an app based on state machines, there‚Äôs this cool library called XState - the one that I used in the aforementioned project and got familiar with (but not entirely, at least yet! üôÇ).

In this article, I will try to share some knowledge about it with you. We will develop a simple React Native app, which handles multi-step forms. Apart from XState, we will use Formik and TypeScript.

### [Awesome Finite State Machines](https://github.com/leonardomso/awesome-fsm)[state-management,state-machine,curated-list]

A curated list of awesome resources related to finite state machines and statecharts.

The main idea of this repository is to have a nice place when people can rely on nice quality content, such as articles, videos, ebooks, documents, books, etc. A little different from the other awesome type lists that we can find in GitHub about a variety of topics, the idea of this list is to provide a nice and short explanation about concepts first, then show a list of nice content related to that specific concept.

### [Welcome to the world of Statecharts](https://statecharts.github.io/)[state-management,state-machine,state-chart]

Put simply, a statechart is a beefed up [state machine](https://statecharts.github.io/what-is-a-state-machine.html). The beefing up solves a lot of the problems that state machines have, especially state explosion that happens as state machines grow. One of the goals of this site is to help explain what statecharts are and how they are useful.

### [Introduction to State Machines Using XState (free video course)](https://egghead.io/courses/introduction-to-state-machines-using-xstate)[state-management,state-machine,state-chart,xstate]

The difficulty of managing state is one of the primary reasons our applications become so complex. We try and manage this complexity with a lot of booleans, somewhat semantic variables like isLoading, wasFetched, and hasError, and over-engineered systems that are still full of bugs. Surely, there's a better way.

That better way is state machines.

**What you'll learn**

- Build a simple machine for a piece of UI
- Build Hierarchical, Parallel, and, History state machines
- Identify the conditions & implement transition guards
- Trigger Actions on transition
- Handle infinite states when working with inputs
- Understand Activities

## Testing

### [How to Test React Components: the Complete Guide](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/testing-react-hooks/)[testing,react,enzyme,react-testing-library,cypress,ci]

Complete Guide, huh, are you going to cover every possible testing scenario? Of course not. However, it will be a complete foundational guide to testing and will be enough to build off of for most other edge cases.

Also I have curated an extensive collection of blog posts, articles and tutorials in the further reading section at the end that should give you enough knowledge to be in the top 10% of developers in terms of testing.

You can find the completed project here:

### [An in-depth beginner's guide to testing React applications](https://jkettmann.com/beginners-guide-to-testing-react/)[testing,jest,mocking,react,react-testing-library]

Unfortunately, writing tests can be a real struggle for beginners. It's like developing in a completely new environment. You may not know what to test. You might spend hours to write a simple test case because you hit error after error. You're used to developing in the browser and it's great dev tools. But testing just doesn't work the same way.

It doesn't have to be that difficult though. With the right approach, you can start writing tests with confidence even as a beginner.

The goal of this blog post is to act as a guide for your first tests. We'll take a small application as an example and cover it with tests. We will discuss what we should test and why we should test it. We will see different techniques that can help us to write tests with confidence without relying on trial and error.

## Typescript

### [Releasing a library written in TypeScript on NPM (YouTube)](https://youtu.be/T_4CCdkN468)[typescript,build,library]

Most of us have used or at least heard about TypeScript, but how many have released a React library written in TypeScript on NPM? In this session we will take a look at the tooling required and some best practices for publishing a library using TypeScript and Rollup.

### [Using Typescript namespaces in create-react-app](https://ostrowski.ninja/typescript-namespaces-cra/)[typescript,react,create-react-app,babel,rescripts]

Typescript namespaces have history from pre-modules JS times. Technically you should use ES Modules if you can. However there are useful cases to encapsulate your types and data in namespaces. How do they work in modern JS/TS world and can you use them in create-react-app?

## UI

### [Gestaltgesetze f√ºr digitale Produkte](https://userinterfacedesign.ch/gestaltgesetze/)[ui,gestalt,spacing]

1. Gesetz der √Ñhnlichkeit

   Gestalten Sie Interface Elemente mit √§hnlichen oder gleichen Inhalten / Funktionen immer gleich.

2. Gesetz der N√§he

   Stellen Sie zusammengeh√∂rende Interface Elemente immer m√∂glichst nah beieinander dar.

3. Gesetz der Pr√§gnanz (guten Gestalt)

   Priorisieren Sie die unterschiedlichen Interface Elemente. Welches Element soll am pr√§gnantesten sein? Tipp: Dieses erkennen Sie, wenn Sie mit zugekniffenen Augen ¬´unscharf¬ª das User Interface betrachten.

4. Gesetz der Geschlossenheit

   Nutzen Sie das Gesetz der Geschlossenheit, um √§hnlich gestaltete Informationen / Funktionen voneinander zu trennen, wenn diese nicht zusammen geh√∂ren. Fassen Sie mittels realen, oder kognitiv erg√§nzten Linien, zusammengeh√∂rende Informationen / Funktionen zu einer Einheit zusammen.

5. Gesetz der Kontinuit√§t

   Wenden Sie die die Wirkung dieses Gesetztes zum Gliedern einzelner Hierarchiestufen an. Inhalte auf der gleichen (erdachten) Fluchtlinie geh√∂ren zur gleichen logischen Ebene. Dies ist zum Beispiel bei einer komplexen Navigation hilfreich.

6. Gesetz des gemeinsamen Schicksals

   Wenden Sie das Gesetz an, um Grundelemente (ruhend) und Figuren (bewegt) zu verdeutlichen.

7. Gesetz der gemeinsamen Regionen

   Grenzen Sie Elemente, die zusammengeh√∂rig sind, mittels hinterlegter Farbfl√§che oder Konturline, von den anderen Elementen ab.

8. Gesetz der Verbundenheit

   Wenden Sie das Gesetz der Verbundenheit an, um Elemente, die zusammen eine Einheit bilden, miteinander zu verbinden.

### [10 Bad Typography Habits that Scream Amateur](https://medium.com/@meetchopz/10-bad-typography-habits-that-scream-amateur-8bac07f9c041)[ui,typography]

1. Center-aligning paragraphs of text
   - Use left aligned text because center align is tough to read.
2. Too much or too little leading
   - Use 120‚Äì145% of font size. I prefer 150%.
3. Eye-popping ALL CAPS
   - Use sentence case on your paragraphs.
4. Hyphenate default ‚Äúon‚Äù
   - Turn off Hyphenate and let Photoshop do the rest.
5. Manually adding line breaks
   - Make it a habit to use Paragraph Text. Do not manually line break your paragraphs. Use Paragraph Text and let Photoshop wrap your sections automatically.
6. Unjustly justification
   - Avoid justifying text. Readability is the priority.
7. Blocks of Text
   - Use around five lines as a maximum.
8. Line Length
   - A good range of line length is between 45‚Äì75 characters ‚Äî 66 including spaces.
9. Characters used as icons
   - Avoid using characters, use scalable vector icons.
10. Text Alignment

- Match your paragraph alignment to that of your design‚Äìif you decide to change the text, it will still look correct, and you don‚Äôt have to keep on nudging to get the right alignment.
